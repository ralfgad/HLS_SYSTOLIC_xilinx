This example illustrates how to define and use an array of streams in the interface.
Instead of defining an array and then using a pragma to map this array to a stream, it
is highly recommended to use the hls::stream objects instead.

In the Vitis kernel mode, these hls::streams will be automatically mapped to AXIS streams.
