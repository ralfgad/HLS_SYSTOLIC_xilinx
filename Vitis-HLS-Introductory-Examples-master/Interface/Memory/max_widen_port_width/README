This example shows how to enable automatic port widening for m_axi ports in the
Vivado IP flow. In the Vitis kernel flow, the following two config_interface 
settings are on by default. It is only in the Vivado IP flow that you have to 
explicit set them.

config_interface -m_axi_max_widen_bitwidth 256
config_interface -m_axi_alignment_byte_size 64
