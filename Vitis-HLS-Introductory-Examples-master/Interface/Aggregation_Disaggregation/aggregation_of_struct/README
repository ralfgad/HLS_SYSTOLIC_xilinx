In this simple example, the aggregation algorithm will create a port
of size 119 bits for port arr (which is mapped to ap_fifo which will
create a streaming interface). The array "myArr" will take 12 bytes (or
96 bits) and the element "length" will take 23 bits for a total of 119
bits.

=========================================================
vitis_hls -f run_hls.tcl

Vitis HLS will issue the following message in the log file:

INFO: [HLS 214-241] Aggregating fifo (array-to-stream) variable 'arr' with compact=bit mode in 119-bits (example.cpp:19:0)
